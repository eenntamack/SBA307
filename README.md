This SBA is created based on a fictional rental car serviece and how it would look like from the user and admin end.
There are two paths :
  1. Admin is the only file without any connected files to it. admin.html
  2. It would be best to start with register.html -> login.html -> user.hmtl
      1.  user.html has a button drop down where you can switch between its catalog and its user file


Admin's file holds user data such as trust, plans and reports

User's file holds personal data, car that is rented , the option to search for other vehicles
